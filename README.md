# 4PanelsLayout

This repos gives a sample layout of website, made of 4 panels made with dividers arranged as follow:

- a TOP divider where you can put an header or whatever you want
- a MAIN divider where the main content of your site will change
- a Right divider located to the right (which you can change to a left one) of the MAIN divivde
- a BOTTOM divider where you can put your site footer
all dividers are styled differently (background color, line colors and styles, margines and paddings) so you can see what can be done.
Enjoy ;)
